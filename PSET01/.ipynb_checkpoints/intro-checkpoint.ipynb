As you may already know to satisfy the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society's Data Science Major's **physical science analytics** domain emphasis requirement, this class will have some programming components. **Our aim is not to scare you because of this requirement**, and we have attempted to make the assignments: as easy as possible, attempt to restrict computational problems to less than 1 hour, and still provide an ample learning experience. Like many of you I have also taken this class, and there's usually 3 reactions to the computational homeworks:\n",

So in lieu of the traditional computational homeworks that you may have seen in Physics 105, the *physics computational training* somewhere hidden in the department website, or 112 in the past years: our focus will be on giving you surface-level knowledge on how to answer research questions using computational techniques.\n",

But, the idea is to make sure these assignments are graded equally. **And as long as you pass all of the public tests you will recieve 85% of your grade so a minimum of ~8.5 points per assignment**. We will also allow the usage of **Chat-GPT**! In fact, we encourage you to use any LLM model that you so desire. However, you should keep in mind the following when using these tools:\n",

    "Creating variables in Python is quite simple, and is analagous to tacking on a number to a variable in math. There are a large number of different datatypes, but for our cases we will only need to look at `int` (integer), `float` (real number), and `str` (letters). Consider the following example:"
